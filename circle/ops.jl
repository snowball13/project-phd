# Script to obtain a point evaluation of the Nth set of OPs for the unit circle

# this code gives some idea about "scope", globals and constants
let
    const x = 5 # the scope of x is only this let block. Because I've put const, f below knows it's an Int
    global f() = x # The "global" indicates that f should be defined outside the let block. It knows x is an Int
end
x  # this is an error because x is not defined
x = 7 # creates a new x with value 7
f()  # returns 5 because f sees the x inside the let block, not the global x

y = 6  # creates a non-constant y
g() = y  # this refers to global y but does not "know" the type of y since it may change
g() # returns the Int 6, but the type is not inferred correctly
y = 7.0
g() # returns the Float64 7.0

@code_warntype f()  # in the console prints out what types are inferred and which are ANY. In the REPL, it will be nicely coloured. Here we see that f knows it returns an Int
@code_warntype g()  # Here we see that g only knows it returns an ANY
